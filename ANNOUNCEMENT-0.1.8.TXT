What is PyQwt3D ( https://github.com/GauiStori/PyQwt3D )?

- It is a fork of the original project http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net
  that is updated to work with Qt5 and Python3

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF/PGF/SVG file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, QwtPlot3D, and NumPy or SciPy in a
  GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- it is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt.
